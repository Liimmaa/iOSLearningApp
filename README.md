# iOSLearningApp
This is an iOS Application built with SwiftUI and MVVM Architecture and as the name implies, it's a personal project started for practice and aimed at improving my skills. The app has it's own Network Layer, implements State management and has been built with the intention of making clean, reusable and maintainable code.

I have used a free api https://newsapi.org/ to display a horizontal and vertical list of News posts.
